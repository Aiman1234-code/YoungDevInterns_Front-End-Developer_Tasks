    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Heart disease includes:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease.</li>
<li>Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.</li>
<li>Heart conditions that you're born with, called congenital heart defects.</li>
<li>Disease of the heart muscle.</li>
<li>Heart valve disease.</li>
<li>Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels</h3>
<p>Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. A buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls usually causes coronary artery disease. This buildup is called plaque. The buildup of plaque in the arteries is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or a stroke.

Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include:
<ul>

<li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort, called angina.</li>

<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly or back.</li>
<li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed.</li>
</ul>
You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, a stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms. Talk with your healthcare team about any concerns. Heart disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups.</p>

<h3>Heart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias</h3>
<p>The heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:
 <ul>   

<li>Chest pain or discomfort.</li>
<li>Dizziness.</li>
<li>Fainting or almost fainting.</li>
<li>Fluttering in the chest.</li>
<li>Lightheadedness.</li>
<li>Racing heartbeat.</li>
<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Slow heartbeat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>Heart disease causes depend on the specific type of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease.</p>
<h3>Causes of coronary artery disease</h3>
<p>A buildup of fatty substances in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, is the most common cause of coronary artery disease. Risk factors include an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and smoking. Healthy-lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of atherosclerosis.</p>
<h3>Causes of irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias</h3>
<p>Common causes of arrhythmias or conditions that can lead to them include:
<ul>
<li>
Heart muscle disease, called cardiomyopathy.</li>
<li>Coronary artery disease.</li>
<li>Diabetes.</li>
<li>Illegal drugs such as cocaine.</li>
<li>Emotional stress.</li>
<li>Too much alcohol or caffeine.</li>
<li>Heart conditions present at birth, called congenital heart defects.</li>

<li>High blood pressure.</li>
<li>Smoking.</li>
<li>Heart valve disease.</li>
<li>Some medicines, herbs and supplements.</li>

</ul>
